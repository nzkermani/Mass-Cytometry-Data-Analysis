Data science tools for analysis mass cytometry by time of flight (CyToF)
Cytometry is measurement of cell characteristics.Features that can be measured by cytometric methods are cell morphology (shape/structure), cell count, DNA content, presence or obsence of a protein on a cell surgace or cell cytoplasm. 

Mass cytometry enables the measurement of up to 50 features on single cell. 
Mass cytometry is a mass spectrometry technique based on inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and time of flight mass spectrometry used for the determination of the properties of cells (cytometry).
In this approach, antibodies are conjugated with isotopically pure elements, and these antibodies are used to label cellular proteins. Cells are nebulized and sent through an argon plasma, which ionizes the metal-conjugated antibodies. The metal signals are then analyzed by a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The approach overcomes limitations of spectral overlap in flow cytometry by utilizing discrete isotopes as a reporter system instead of traditional fluorophores which have broad emission spectra.[3]


Fluidigm Corporation is currently the only vendor of mass cytometry instruments with their CyTOF systems. The first CyTOF was released in 2009, followed by the CyTOF2® in 2013, and most recently the Helios™ in 2015.
