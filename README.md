Data science tools for analysis mass cytometry by time of flight (CyToF)
Cytometry is measurement of cell characteristics.Features that can be measured by cytometric methods are cell morphology (shape/structure), cell count, DNA content, presence or obsence of a protein on a cell surgace or cell cytoplasm. 

Mass cytometry enables the measurement of up to 100 features on single cell. 
The Cytometry by Time Of Flight (CyTOF) mass cytometer is an adaptation of an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) modified for high-dimensional cytometric applications.

For a Mass cytometry experiment, cells are stained with antibodies, and metal isotopes are employed as reporter groups. Staining panels of 35 or more antibodies are designed to quantify cell surface phenotypes, cell cycle state, apoptosis, metabolism, proliferation, and activation states of intracellular signaling pathways, as depicted in figure below:

Mass cytometry is a mass spectrometry technique based on inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and time of flight mass spectrometry used for the determination of the properties of cells (cytometry).
In this approach, cells of interest are cross-linked by formaldehyde, permeabilized using methanol or detergents, and labeled with antibodies conjugated to pure metal isotopes of defined mass. Subsequently, cells are nebulized, ionized and atomized in a ∼7000 K hot plasma and introduced into the mass cytometer, which is a hybrid quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Here, the composition and quantity of the reporter (metal) isotopes are determined. Signals corresponding to each isotope are then correlated with presence of the respective marker per single-cell event.


Fluidigm Corporation is currently the only vendor of mass cytometry instruments with their CyTOF systems. The first CyTOF was released in 2009, followed by the CyTOF2® in 2013, and most recently the Helios™ in 2015.
